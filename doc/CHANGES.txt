Version 0.17

  - Bugfix for incorrect processing of multipart/form-data in case
    the payload size exceeds the read buffer size. Contributed by Armin Abfalterer

Version 0.16

  - Bugfix for losing parameter with non content-type text/plain
    when deleting paramters. Contributed by Petar Bogdanovic

Version 0.15

  - Incoperates bug fix patch contributed by JamesWright
    http://sourceforge.net/p/parp/bugs/3/

Version 0.14

  - Fixes potential endless loop when processing huge parameters.

Version 0.13

  - PARP_BodyData supports "*/*" to process any content type.

Version 0.12

  - Allows other modules to delete parameters by adding the parameter
    name to the PARP_DELETE_PARAM r->notes table.

Version 0.11

  - the array and table entries returned by parp hooks contains the body 
    as well as the query parameters
  - the entries returnd by the parp modify_hook contains a field "delete",
    when it's set to "1" the whole parameter incl. name will be removed
  - can deal with RFC 1341 Multipart preamble and epilogue
  - handels content-type text/plain correctly for multipart formdata
  - new hook: modify_hook (replaces modify_body_hook)
  - new type: parp_entry_t (replaces parp_body_entry_t)
  - DEPRECATED: parp_body_entry_t
  - DEPRECATED: modify_body_hook

Version 0.10

  - Error description if reading from client has failed, e.g. connection
    has been closed or a filter of another Apache module has canceled
    the request.

Version 0.9

  - modify_body_hook provides an array of parp_body_entry_t enties.
    Each entry contains the parameter key and value as well as a
    "new_value" field which allows parameter manipulation (you may
    change the parameter's value by writing a new value string
    to the "new_value" field).
    The hook is executed at the header parser, similar to the hp_hook.

Version 0.8

  - Stores the content-length of the processed data within the
    PARPContentLength environment variable (may be used to
    adjust the content-length header when using mod_deflate).

Version 0.7

  - Ignore input filter date on error, else keepalive connection could hang 
    for ever (actually until timeout).

Version 0.6

  - Export body data reader.

Version 0.5

  - Security fix in the get payload function, Apache
    will reuse data buffer of buckets on the next burst
    of bytes.

Version 0.4

  - Ignore request method. Try to read request body
    if there is any.

Version 0.3

  - Correct content-length header if mod_deflate has
    unzipped the request body when reading the data
    from the client.

Version 0.1

  - Urlencrypted and multipart form data parser

  - Supports recursive multipart boundaries
    (hard limited to a 2 recursions)
